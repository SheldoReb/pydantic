# pydantic

## Introduction

Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library for Python, based on Python type annotations. It provides a way to define data structures with type hints and validate data against these structures. Pydantic is widely used for data validation, serialization, and settings management in Python applications.

## Features

- Data validation using Python type annotations
- Automatic type conversion
- Serialization and deserialization of data
- Settings management with environment variable support
- Integration with popular web frameworks like FastAPI and Django

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str

user = User(id=1, name='John Doe', email='john.doe@example.com')
print(user)
```

### Data Validation

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str

try:
    user = User(id='one', name='John Doe', email='john.doe@example.com')
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e)
```

### Settings Management

```python
from pydantic import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    app_name: str
    admin_email: str

    class Config:
        env_prefix = 'APP_'

settings = Settings()
print(settings.app_name)
print(settings.admin_email)
```

## Agents in Pydantic

Pydantic also supports the concept of agents, which are used to manage and validate data in a more complex and dynamic way. Agents can be used to handle data validation and transformation in real-time applications, such as web services and data pipelines.

### Example of Agents

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Agent(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    role: str = Field(..., description="The role of the agent")

agent = Agent(id=1, name='Agent Smith', role='Security')
print(agent)
```
